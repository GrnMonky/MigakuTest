Things to Note:
- The animations are not exactly 1:1. I slowed them down to highlight that they are animations.
- Clicking the '->' button switches to using the GitHub API, demonstrating the use of a real API.

Known Issues to Fix:
- The large button is not perfect. It frustrates me, and I would like to perfect it with more time.
- Networking could be cleaner, and overall the code could benefit from some refactoring.

Decisions I Made:
- I assumed that the inverted appearance of the top "Study" button when pressed was intentional. So, I made the press animation match the top button. It also uses an inverse mask instead of a gradient, unlike the design.
